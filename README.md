### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've worked in software development for 8+ years. I've worked in full stack web development for the last 4+ years, focused on frontend work. I am looking for frontend focused engineering positions, let me know if you're interested!

Currently, I'm working at [Tech Ladies](https://www.hiretechladies.com/), where I'm adding features to their public website and job board.

In the past, I've worked at the [Getty Research Institute](https://www.getty.edu/research/) (within the Getty Museum) on the [Getty Research Portal](https://portal.getty.edu/).

The rest of my work was for internal use and is covered under NDA's.

Feel free to reach out!
